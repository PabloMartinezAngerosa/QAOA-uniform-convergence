# Qiskit Quantum Computing: Uniform Convergence in QAOA Algorithm


## Overview

This repository showcases a Python codebase utilizing Qiskit, IBM's open-source quantum computing framework, to demonstrate uniform convergence in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Qiskit provides tools for simulating and executing quantum circuits on real quantum hardware. The QAOA is a hybrid quantum-classical optimization algorithm used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This project aims to exhibit the uniform convergence behavior of QAOA by utilizing Qiskit's capabilities.

## Background

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that combines classical and quantum computing to solve optimization problems. The algorithm uses a series of parameterized quantum circuits to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. The concept of uniform convergence in the context of QAOA refers to the behavior of the algorithm as the number of optimization steps increases, converging towards a stable solution.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qiskit-qaoa-uniform-convergence.git
   cd qiskit-qaoa-uniform-convergence
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the uniform convergence demonstration by executing `uniform_convergence_qaoa.py`. This script employs Qiskit to simulate the behavior of the QAOA algorithm and showcase its uniform convergence characteristics.

2. Adjust the parameters and settings in the script to experiment with different optimization problems and convergence behaviors.
